# Multimodal Agent
## Overview
This project demonstrates a **multimodal AI agent** built with the OpenAI API that can process **text and images**, generate responses, and interact in a conversational workflow. It is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (Multimodal_Agent.ipynb), designed for experimentation and extension.
## Features
* Accepts **text input** and **image input**.
* Uses **OpenAI GPT models** for reasoning and response generation.
* Encodes images using base64 for API compatibility.
* Can be run directly in Google Colab with support for secret management via **google.colab.userdata**.
